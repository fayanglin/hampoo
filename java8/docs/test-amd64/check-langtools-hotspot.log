For brief details about a topic, use "-help <term> ...". The argument <term> is
a command option or other word related to the topic. Use "-help all" to show all
of the help entries.

Information is available for the following topics.

Verbose Options
                These options control the amount of output written to the
                console while running tests

Documentation Options
                Options for additional documentation
General Options

Test Selection Options
                These options can be used to refine the set of tests to be
                executed.

Test Mode Options
                When the JavaTest harness is used to run tests, two possibly
                different versions of the JDK are used: the JDK version used to
                run the harness and the JDK version used to run the test(s). The
                following options provide a means to specify the JDK version
                used to run the tests. The default is to use the same JDK
                version (provided by JAVA_HOME) for both the harness and the
                tests, and for each test to run in its own JVM.

JDK-related Options
                By default, tests will be run using the default JVM in the test
                JDK. You can pass all applicable JVM options via using
                -vmoption; in addition, most common JVM options are also
                supported directly. For full details of any option, consult the
                documentation for that version of the JDK, or try using "java
                -help" or "java -X". If an option is not applicable to a
                particular platform or JDK release, it will be rejected.


For more details and examples, see the online help. You can access this directly
from the command line with "-onlineHelp <word>...", or you can start the
JavaTest harness and use the Help menu.

jtreg can also be run with Ant. See the online help for details. For example,
use the "-onlineHelp ant" command line option.
